# Webexx_Project
Webexx is a popular web conferencing and collaboration platform that allows users to participate in online meetings, webinars, and video conferences. By creating a clone of Webexx, I have built a similar frontend of webexx .

Where I used a Html,tailwind css,Javascript for this project.

In this project I learned how big companies designed their frontend what the parameter they take to make a website interactive.The user used our app daily and faced no difficulty to use any our product.
